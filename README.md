# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a data analysis and visualization notebook that tracks COVID-19 trends globally. It uses real-world data from **Our World in Data** to explore patterns in cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across multiple countries.

## 📌 Objectives

- Import and clean real-world COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends for confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare key metrics across selected countries
- Visualize trends using line and bar charts
- Present insights using both code and narrative in a Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- (Optional) [plotly](https://plotly.com/) or [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) for advanced visualizations

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Download the dataset from [Our World in Data - COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv).
3. Place `owid-covid-data.csv` in the same folder as the notebook.
4. Open `covid_tracker.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
5. Run all cells to explore the analysis and visualizations.

> ⚠️ Make sure required packages are installed. You can install them with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
📊 Key Insights
The United States had early and large-scale vaccination rollout.

India experienced significant case spikes during the Delta wave.

Kenya showed slower but steady vaccine adoption in 2021–2022.

Death rates varied significantly across regions and timeframes.

🧠 Reflections
This project demonstrates how open data can be used to monitor global health events. By combining data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, we gain a clearer understanding of how different countries responded to the pandemic and what the outcomes were.
